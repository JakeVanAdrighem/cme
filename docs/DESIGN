The process described below is primarily defined by
the C standard N1548.

Compilation Process:
	Clean up Multi-byte chars
	Clean up newlines(Leave the last newline before EOF)
	lex(Scan)
	Preprocess
	parse
	load into "IR" form(??? isn't this just the second half of parsing)
	(maybe optimize)
	lower instructions
	pass off to linker
	DONE

Different components:
TranslationUnit
	Globals
	Functions
		Blocks
			Instructions
				Operands

Data hierarchy should probably be defined
in a bottom up manner. 

Components(operands) of instructions should
have some structure to generalize them.
