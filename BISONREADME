Notes on bison:

Bison grammar files appear to have a format very similar to that of flex.
Definitions or something similar followed by rules of the language.

options:

%debug - set the parser macro YYDEBUG to be 1 if not already set.
This enables compilation of "debugging facilities".

%defines - Creates a header file containing macro definitions of
the token type names. Generally allows for external definition of
yylex.

%error-verbose - Pretty obvious?

%token-table - Generates an array of token names in the parser file.
Maps token code numbers to token names in the array yytname

%verbose - "Write an extra output file containing verbose descriptions of the parser states and what is done for each type of look-ahead token in that state."
