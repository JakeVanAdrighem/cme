Notes on Flex.

Options:
8bit - flex will generate a scanner capable of recognizing 8bit characters.  
ecs  - Create equivalence classes where possible. This reduces table size.
debug - Put the scanner into debug mode which I believe is the equivalent of verbose mode
for rule matching.
nodefault - prevents the "default rule" from being used. This causes inputs which don't
match the scanner rules to generate errors rather than being printed to stdout.
noyywrap - causes the scanner to behave as though the yywrap() function has returned 1
in all cases. Check the flex man page for an explanation of EOF handling behavior and
its relationship with yywrap.
perf-report - flex generates a report to stderr regarding features of the
implementation which will have a significant impact on scanner performance.
verbose - flex will print a summary report to stderr with statistics about the scanner
generated
warn - "warn about certain things. In particular, if the default rule can be matched but no default rule has been given, the flex will warn you."

Macros:
YY_USER_ACTION - Defines behavior to be performed before a matched rule's action.

Definitions:

Give names to things. Definitions always have the form:
name definition
